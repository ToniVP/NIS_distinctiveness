# NIS_distinctiveness
This repository contains all the compiled data, code and further generated data from the work "A trait-based approach to assess niche overlap and functional distinctiveness between non-indigenous and native species" authored by Antoni Vivó-Pons, Mats Blomqvist, Anna Törnroos and Martin Lindegren.

## Code description
-[] [01_Descriptive_figures](https://github.com/ToniVP/NIS_distinctiveness/blob/main/Code/01_Descriptive%20figures.R). This script contains the code related to the descriptive figures of the data used in the study: 
- Figure 2: Maps of the sampled stations, species richness, Shannon diversity, relative biomass of NIS, and % of NIS species in local communities.
- Figure S1: Biomass of the NIS and native species.
- Figure S4: Maps of environmental variables used in the models
- Figure S6: Depth distribution of NIS

[02_Distinctiveness_regional (Step I & II)](https://github.com/ToniVP/NIS_distinctiveness/blob/main/Code/02_Distinctiveness_regional%20(Step%20I%20%26%20II).R). This script corresponds to the 1st and 2nd steps in the proposed framework
